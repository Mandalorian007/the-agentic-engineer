# Agentic Engineer Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 6, 2025

## Introduction

Agentic Engineer LLC (“Agentic Engineer,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through this Privacy Policy (“Policy”). This Policy describes the information we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and your choices.

This Policy applies to information we collect: (i) on our website at https://agentic-engineer.com (the "Website"), (ii) in email, text, and other electronic messages between you and the Website, (iii) through any mobile or desktop applications we provide that link to this Policy, and (iv) when you interact with our applications on third-party services where this Policy is linked.

This Policy does not apply to data collected, handled, or processed by customers through our application programming interface (API) or through third-party APIs and integrations (e.g., Stripe, OpenAI, Google’s Gemini). Those providers process your information under their own terms and privacy policies. Please review those third-party policies before sharing personal information with them.

By accessing or using the Website, you agree to this Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Website.

For questions about this Policy or to exercise your rights, you may contact us at support@agentic-engineer.com.

## Children's Privacy

The Website is not intended for children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn we collected personal information from a child under 13 without verified parental consent, we will delete it. If you believe we might have information from or about a child under 13, contact support@agentic-engineer.com.

We do not knowingly sell or share personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

Residents of certain states, under 13, 16, or 18, may have additional rights (see *Your State Privacy Rights*).

## Information We Collect

We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, or could reasonably be linked with you (“Personal Information”), including:

- Identifiers and contact information (e.g., name, email address).
- Account information (e.g., authentication status from identity provider; basic profile fields).
- Transactional information (e.g., subscription status and billing metadata from our payment processor).
- Usage information related to your interaction with the Website (e.g., pages viewed, features used), collected in a manner that is aggregated or irreversibly anonymized and not used to identify you.

## Sources of Information

- Directly from you, when you register, subscribe, communicate with us, or otherwise provide information.
- Automatically, through limited, privacy-preserving techniques described below.
- From service providers that support identity, subscription, payments, hosting, and security.

## How We Use Information

We use information to:

- Operate, maintain, and provide the Website and related services;
- Authenticate users and administer subscriptions;
- Process payments and send transactional notices;
- Maintain security and prevent fraud and abuse;
- Improve the Website, including testing, research, and diagnostics based on aggregated or anonymized analytics;
- Communicate with you about updates or changes; and
- Fulfill any other purpose that you request or to which you consent.

We do not use your Personal Information for behavioral or interest-based advertising, and we do not sell or share Personal Information for targeted advertising or profiling.

## Cookies and Similar Technologies

We use only strictly necessary cookies or similar technologies to: (i) authenticate users and manage sessions (via Clerk), and (ii) facilitate secure payments (via Stripe). These cookies are required for the Website to function. If you block strictly-necessary cookies, some features may not work.

We do not use third-party pixels or SDKs for cross-site tracking or targeted advertising on the Website. We do not deploy remarketing tags.

We provide notice of cookie use at or before collection, consistent with applicable law.

## Analytics

We may perform analytics that are user-agnostic and operate on aggregated or anonymized data to understand overall usage, improve features, enhance security, and optimize performance.

Such analytics are conducted using data that cannot reasonably be re-identified, and we do not combine analytics with identifiers to profile individuals.

## AI-Enabled Features

Some features may utilize artificial intelligence technologies (e.g., OpenAI and Google's Gemini) to assist with content or experiences. Your inputs may be processed by these AI tools solely to fulfill the functionality you request. These AI tools do not have direct or independent access to our systems or user data. Use of AI features is optional and subject to the third-party providers' terms.

## Service Providers and Infrastructure

To provide the Website, we rely on reputable third parties:

- Clerk for identity and subscription management (e.g., basic profile information such as name and email when you log in with Google or Discord). We do not collect or store third-party platform passwords.
- Stripe for payment processing. Stripe collects and processes payment details directly; we receive limited subscription metadata (e.g., name, email) for billing and support. We do not store your full payment card details.
- Convex for application data hosting used solely for operational/system functions. We do not store personally identifiable or payment information in Convex beyond what is operationally necessary.

All service providers are contractually bound to use Personal Information only to provide services to us and to implement appropriate security measures.

## Disclosure of Information

We may disclose information:

- To our affiliates, contractors, and service providers who support the Website and are bound to use it only to provide services to us;
- In connection with a corporate transaction (e.g., merger, investment, acquisition, financing, or asset transfer);
- To comply with law, legal process, or governmental requests;
- To enforce our Terms, ensure security, prevent fraud, or protect rights, property, and safety; and
- With your direction or consent.

We do not disclose Personal Information to third parties for their own marketing purposes, and we do not sell or share Personal Information for targeted advertising.

## Your Choices

You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of Personal Information by emailing support@agentic-engineer.com. We may need to verify your identity. Deleting your Personal Information may require deletion of your account. We may retain information where permitted or required by law.

## Security

We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Information against accidental loss and unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. You are responsible for safeguarding any credentials associated with your account.

## Data Retention

We retain Personal Information for as long as needed to provide the Website, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, protect our rights, or as otherwise permitted by law. We aim to minimize retention consistent with our operational needs.

When we no longer need your Personal Information, we securely delete or anonymize it.

## International Transfers

Agentic Engineer LLC, headquartered in New Jersey, United States, is the data controller for the processing activities described in this Policy.

Information we collect is processed and stored in the U.S. or in other countries where our trusted service providers maintain facilities. If you access the Website from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with local laws.

Where required by applicable data protection law, we implement appropriate safeguards to ensure that cross-border transfers of Personal Information are lawful, secure, and compliant. These safeguards may include:

- The use of Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or other competent authorities;
- Transfers to countries determined by regulators to provide an adequate level of data protection; and
- Other lawful mechanisms consistent with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the UK GDPR, and comparable international frameworks.

By using the Website or providing us with information, you acknowledge that your Personal Information may be transferred to and processed in the United States and other jurisdictions where privacy laws may not offer the same level of protection as those in your home country. We take steps to ensure that your information remains protected in accordance with this Policy and applicable law.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the updated Policy on this page and revise the "Last Updated" date above. Material changes may also be announced via a Website notice. Your continued use of the Website after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.
