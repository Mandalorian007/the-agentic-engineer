**Last Updated:** November 6, 2025

Introduction; Acceptance of Terms; Ownership

These Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms of Use”) govern your access to and use of the Agentic Engineer platforms and services (collectively, the “Agentic Engineer Platforms”), which are operated by Agentic Engineer LLC and its affiliates (“Agentic Engineer,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By clicking “accept,” downloading, installing, or using any part of the Agentic Engineer Platforms, you (“you,” “user,” or “visitor”) agree to be bound by these Terms of Use in full.

The user should carefully read and understand the Terms of Use before accessing or using the Agentic Engineer Platforms. These Terms of Use outline the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of both the user and Agentic Engineer and govern the user’s access to and use of the Agentic Engineer Platforms. By accessing or using the Agentic Engineer Platforms in any way, the user acknowledges that they have read and understood the Terms of Use in their entirety and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. This is a legally binding agreement between the user and Agentic Engineer. If the user does not fully agree with any part of the Terms of Use, the user should immediately refrain from using the Agentic Engineer Platforms. Continued use of the Agentic Engineer Platforms constitutes the user’s consent to abide by these Terms of Use and to be bound by them in their entirety.

1. Access to the Agentic Engineer Platforms. Agentic Engineer agrees to provide access to the Agentic Engineer Platforms in accordance with these Terms of Use.

1. Disclaimer of Warranties; Service Availability. The Agentic Engineer Platforms are provided “as is” and “as available,” without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee that the Platforms will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of defects, nor that they will meet your expectations or requirements. Access may be temporarily or permanently interrupted due to maintenance, technical issues, or other factors beyond our control. Agentic Engineer reserves the right to modify or discontinue any aspect of the Platforms at any time without notice.

1. Beta Features; Evaluation Terms; Confidentiality. From time to time, we may offer beta versions, pilot features, or early access components of the Agentic Engineer Platforms (“Beta Features”) to a limited group of users for testing, feedback, and evaluation purposes. Participation in any Beta Feature is entirely voluntary and may be subject to additional terms, conditions, or confidentiality obligations as specified by us at the time of access.

   Beta Features are provided solely for evaluation and experimentation and are offered on an “as is,” “as available,” and “with all faults” basis. We expressly disclaim any and all warranties, express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, data accuracy, or system integration, with respect to any Beta Features.

   We make no guarantee that Beta Features will be free of defects, operate without interruption, or be made available as part of the publicly released version of the Platforms. By participating in Beta Features, you acknowledge that such features may be unstable, may result in data loss or unexpected behavior, and may be discontinued at any time without notice.

   You agree not to disclose any non-public information relating to Beta Features without our prior written consent. You further acknowledge that any feedback, suggestions, or improvements you provide may be used by us without compensation or attribution, and you grant Agentic Engineer a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide, and transferable license (with the right to sublicense) to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, display, perform, and create derivative works from such feedback for any purpose.

1. NO PROFESSIONAL ADVICE; INFORMATIONAL CONTENT ONLY. ALL MATERIALS, OPINIONS, ADVICE, STATEMENTS, MEMORANDA, OR OTHER CONTENT DISPLAYED OR DISTRIBUTED BY AGENTIC ENGINEER ON THE AGENTIC ENGINEER PLATFORMS (THE “AGENTIC ENGINEER CONTENT”) ARE INTENDED SOLELY FOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES. THE AGENTIC ENGINEER CONTENT IS NOT AND SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED AS PROFESSIONAL ADVICE OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING LEGAL, MEDICAL, FINANCIAL, OR ANY OTHER LICENSED PROFESSIONAL ADVICE. FOR SPECIFIC LEGAL ADVICE OR GUIDANCE RELATED TO THE USER’S PERSONAL OR BUSINESS SITUATION, THE USER IS STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO RETAIN QUALIFIED LEGAL COUNSEL OR CONSULT WITH OTHER APPROPRIATE LICENSED PROFESSIONALS. AGENTIC ENGINEER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR ENDORSEMENTS REGARDING THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR RELIABILITY OF THE AGENTIC ENGINEER CONTENT. BY USING THE AGENTIC ENGINEER PLATFORMS, THE USER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY RELIANCE ON ANY AGENTIC ENGINEER CONTENT IS DONE AT THE USER’S SOLE RISK, AND THE USER ASSUMES FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING FROM SUCH RELIANCE. AGENTIC ENGINEER RESERVES THE RIGHT, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, TO MODIFY, UPDATE, OR CORRECT ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY PORTION OF THE AGENTIC ENGINEER PLATFORMS. 

1. TERMINATION BY EITHER PARTY. USER ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE AGENTIC ENGINEER PLATFORMS MAY BE TERMINATED AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE, BY EITHER THE USER OR BY AGENTIC ENGINEER. THE USER HAS THE RIGHT TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE AGENTIC ENGINEER PLATFORMS AT ANY TIME BY CEASING TO ACCESS OR INTERACT WITH THE AGENTIC ENGINEER PLATFORMS. SIMILARLY, AGENTIC ENGINEER RESERVES THE RIGHT, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, TO SUSPEND, RESTRICT, OR TERMINATE THE USER’S ACCESS TO THE AGENTIC ENGINEER PLATFORMS, OR ANY ASSOCIATED FEATURES, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE, AND FOR ANY REASON, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO VIOLATION OF THE TERMS OF USE, INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR, NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE AGENTIC ENGINEER PLATFORM RULES, OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON DEEMED NECESSARY BY AGENTIC ENGINEER. IN THE EVENT OF TERMINATION BY EITHER PARTY, AGENTIC ENGINEER WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR CONSEQUENCES THAT ARISE FROM THE TERMINATION, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, CONTENT, OR ACCESS TO SERVICES. THE USER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, UPON TERMINATION, ANY CONTENT, MATERIALS, OR DATA SUBMITTED BY THE USER TO THE AGENTIC ENGINEER PLATFORMS MAY BE DELETED OR BECOME INACCESSIBLE, AND AGENTIC ENGINEER WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SUCH LOSS OR INACCESSIBILITY. FOR INFORMATION ON THE EFFECTS OF TERMINATION AND SURVIVING PROVISIONS, SEE SECTION 17.

1. Data Collection and Privacy Practices. Agentic Engineer may, subject to and in accordance with its Privacy Policy and applicable law, collect and process limited information from users for authentication, subscription management, and payment purposes. Agentic Engineer uses Clerk to manage user identity and subscriptions. Users may log in via Google or Discord, in which case Clerk receives only the basic profile information provided by those services (such as name and email address). Agentic Engineer does not collect or store passwords or other credentials from third-party platforms. All payment processing is handled by Stripe, which collects and processes payment details directly and securely. Agentic Engineer receives only the user’s name and email address to administer subscriptions and send billing communications. No credit card or banking information is stored by Agentic Engineer. Application data is hosted on Convex, used solely for operational and system functions. No personally identifiable or payment information is stored in Convex. Analytics used by Agentic Engineer are fully user-agnostic and operate only on aggregated or anonymized data. No analytical tools collect or process information that can identify individual users. By accessing or using the Agentic Engineer Platforms, the user expressly acknowledges and consents to the limited data collection and processing described herein and in the Agentic Engineer Privacy Policy, available at https://agentic-engineer.com/privacy, which is incorporated by reference into these Terms of Use. Agentic Engineer does not sell or disclose personal information to third parties for marketing or profiling purposes and retains such information only as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. Users may request access to, correction of, or deletion of personal data by contacting support@agentic-engineer.com, as further described in the Privacy Policy.

1. Advertising and Analytics. Agentic Engineer does not engage in behavioral or interest-based advertising and does not sell or share personal information for advertising or profiling purposes. Any analytics implemented on the Agentic Engineer Platforms are user-agnostic and operate only on aggregated or de-identified data that does not identify individual users. Cookies or similar technologies used on the Agentic Engineer Platforms are limited to those strictly necessary for authentication and subscription management (via Clerk) and payment processing (via Stripe). For clarity, Agentic Engineer does not use third-party pixels or software development kits (SDKs) for cross-site tracking or targeted advertising on the Agentic Engineer Platforms.

1. Debt Collection Communications. If you owe Agentic Engineer any outstanding amounts, you expressly consent to receive related communications, including emails, as permitted by applicable law. These communications may be sent by Agentic Engineer or authorized third-party service providers, subject to applicable debt-collection laws and regulations. You agree that any email address provided to Agentic Engineer may be used for debt-related correspondence and confirm that it is a personal address under your control, not a work or shared account. You are responsible for keeping your contact information current, and failure to do so may result in missed notices that could affect your ability to resolve outstanding balances. Payment confirmations, renewal notices, and other transactional communications may also be sent by Stripe on Agentic Engineer’s behalf solely for billing purposes. For information about how we collect, use, and store data, please refer to our Privacy Policy.

1. Subscriptions; Auto-Renewal; Cancellation. Paid subscriptions, if offered, renew automatically at the end of each billing period unless canceled in accordance with these Terms. Agentic Engineer will provide clear renewal terms, advance notice of renewal, and a cancellation method that is as simple as the method used to sign up. By purchasing a subscription, you authorize Agentic Engineer LLC (or its payment processor, Stripe) to charge the applicable subscription fee and any taxes to your designated payment method on a recurring basis until you cancel.

   If a free trial is offered, the subscription will convert to a paid plan at the end of the trial period unless you cancel before conversion. You may cancel at any time—effective at the end of the then-current billing period—through your account settings or by following the in-platform cancellation link provided in your renewal notice. Cancellation shall not require a phone call or email communication. Except where required by law or expressly stated otherwise, fees are non-refundable and partial periods are not prorated.

   Agentic Engineer will provide reasonable advance notice of any material changes to subscription pricing or terms. Any such changes will apply beginning with your next billing period unless you cancel before that renewal date. If required by applicable automatic-renewal or subscription-contract laws, Agentic Engineer will obtain your affirmative consent before applying material changes to your plan or pricing.

1. Copyright; Limited License; No Transfer of Rights. The Agentic Engineer Platforms, including all Agentic Engineer Content displayed, performed, or made available on the Agentic Engineer Platforms, are protected by copyright laws as a collective work and/or compilation pursuant to U.S. copyright laws, international conventions, and applicable copyright laws in other jurisdictions. Subject to these Terms of Use, the user is granted a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to view and download one copy of the Agentic Engineer Content for personal, non-commercial use. The user is expressly prohibited from removing, altering, or obscuring any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices that appear on or within the Agentic Engineer Content, including any rights-management information, watermarks, or other identification markers. The user may not use the Agentic Engineer Content in any manner that could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of Agentic Engineer or any third-party rights holders. All Agentic Engineer Content is owned, controlled, or licensed by Agentic Engineer or the party responsible for creating such content, and the user agrees to abide by any and all copyright notices, restrictions, or terms of use provided with the Agentic Engineer Content. No title, ownership interest, or other intellectual property rights are transferred to the user by access to or use of the Agentic Engineer Platforms or the Agentic Engineer Content.

1. Platform Changes; Access Limitations. Agentic Engineer is not able to confirm that the Agentic Engineer Content is correct in every case. Agentic Engineer reserves the right to make changes to the Agentic Engineer Platforms, including the Agentic Engineer Content, at any time and without notice or liability. Agentic Engineer may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict the user’s access to parts or all of the Agentic Engineer Platforms at any time and without notice or liability.

1. Artificial Intelligence; Third-Party Service Providers. Certain features of the Agentic Engineer Platforms use artificial-intelligence technologies (the “AI Tools”), including but not limited to OpenAI’s and Google’s Gemini AI services. The AI Tools assist with dynamic storytelling, content creation, and related functionality. Your interactions with AI-enabled features may involve the temporary processing of your inputs by these AI Tools solely to fulfill your request. Such processing is limited to the specific request, is not retained by Agentic Engineer for model training or profiling, and does not grant the AI Tools persistent access to your data. Processing by the AI Tools is subject to their respective published terms and privacy policies.

   Agentic Engineer makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, reliability, legality, or fitness for purpose of any output generated by the AI Tools and expressly disclaims responsibility for any errors, omissions, or consequences arising from such output. You acknowledge that all AI-generated material is provided “as is,” “as available,” and “with all faults,” and that your use of any such material is at your own risk.

   Certain operational functions of the Agentic Engineer Platforms—including authentication, subscription management, payment processing, and data storage—are supported by third-party service providers such as Clerk, Stripe, and Convex. Each provider operates under its own security and privacy standards and terms of service. Use of features supported by these providers constitutes your acknowledgment and agreement that those services are governed by their respective terms and privacy policies, which you are responsible for reviewing.

1. Age and Eligibility Requirements; Children’s Privacy. The Agentic Engineer Platforms are not intended for children under the age of thirteen (13). We do not knowingly collect, store, or process any personal information from individuals under thirteen (13) years of age. You must be at least thirteen (13) years old to create an account or access the Agentic Engineer Platforms. If you are between thirteen (13) and eighteen (18) years of age, you represent that you have obtained the consent of a parent or legal guardian to use the Agentic Engineer Platforms and to agree to these Terms of Use. Authentication and access to the Agentic Engineer Platforms occur through Google or Discord accounts managed by Clerk, and individuals under thirteen (13) years of age are not eligible to register. Because authentication and access depend on third-party account credentials, individuals under the age of thirteen (13) cannot lawfully create an account or submit any personal information to Agentic Engineer. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the age of thirteen (13) without verified parental consent, we will promptly delete such information from our records. Parents and guardians are encouraged to monitor their children’s online activity and ensure compliance with these age restrictions. If you are a California resident under the age of sixteen (16), you may have additional rights regarding the collection, sale, and deletion of your personal information. For more information regarding the rights of minors under California law, please review our Privacy Policy, which includes details about how we handle personal data in accordance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the CPRA).

1. Communications; No Confidentiality; Security Notice. The user acknowledges that transmissions to and from the Agentic Engineer Platforms, including but not limited to emails, messages, and other forms of communication, are not secure or confidential. Communications sent via the Internet, including emails, are inherently vulnerable to interception, unauthorized access, and potential alteration by third parties. As a result, Agentic Engineer cannot and does not guarantee the privacy, security, or confidentiality of any communications sent to or from the Agentic Engineer Platforms, including those transmitted via email. The user also agrees that any violation of this section, including but not limited to using the Agentic Engineer Platforms for illegal activity such as repeated unwanted emails or “spam” activity, may result in legal action. Agentic Engineer reserves the right to pursue legal remedies to the fullest extent permitted by law against individuals or entities engaging in such unlawful behavior. The user acknowledges that by submitting communications to Agentic Engineer, no confidential, fiduciary, contractually implied, or any other relationship is created or established between the user and Agentic Engineer, except as expressly provided under these Terms of Use and any subsequent written agreement entered into with Agentic Engineer. Any communication or submission made by the user to Agentic Engineer will not create any expectation of confidentiality beyond what is explicitly outlined in these Terms of Use or any formal agreement entered into between the user and Agentic Engineer. 

1. No Waiver. Agentic Engineer<a name="_hlk188004512"></a>’s failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Use or take any immediate action in response to a violation of these Terms of Use, shall not be construed as a waiver, relinquishment, or limitation of Agentic Engineer’s right to subsequently enforce that provision or any other provision of these Terms of Use at any future time. The user acknowledges and agrees that Agentic Engineer retains the right, at its sole discretion, to enforce these Terms of Use rigorously and to compel strict compliance with all provisions, regardless of whether Agentic Engineer has previously refrained from doing so or has failed to take immediate action in response to prior violations. In the event Agentic Engineer chooses to waive enforcement of a specific provision temporarily, this waiver does not extend to any subsequent violations of the same provision or other provisions of these Terms of Use, and Agentic Engineer reserves the right to enforce all provisions of these Terms of Use in full, at any time, without prior notice. 

1. Severability. These Terms of Use shall be deemed severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions herein under any applicable law or regulation shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions herein. If any provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable in a particular jurisdiction or context, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of that provision in other jurisdictions or situations where it remains valid and enforceable. Agentic Engineer reserves the right to make any necessary amendments to these Terms of Use to ensure that all provisions are valid, enforceable, and reflect the original intent of Agentic Engineer.

1. Suspension and Termination; Effect of Termination. Either you or Agentic Engineer has the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Agentic Engineer Platforms at any time, for any reason, and without prior notice. Agentic Engineer reserves the right to exercise this right at its sole discretion, based on factors such as, but not limited to, violation of these Terms of Use, security concerns, maintenance requirements, or any other operational considerations. If you choose to terminate your access to the Agentic Engineer Platforms, you must provide notice to Agentic Engineer through the appropriate communication channels as specified by Agentic Engineer. The termination will take effect upon Agentic Engineer’s receipt of your notice, and all access privileges associated with your account or login will be revoked at that time. In the event of termination, you acknowledge that any Agentic Engineer Content, as well as any rights you may have to access such content, may be lost, and Agentic Engineer will not be liable for any such loss. Additionally, Agentic Engineer may, at its sole discretion, retain certain information for legal, administrative, or record-keeping purposes, as permitted under applicable laws or its Privacy Policy. The termination of access by either you or Agentic Engineer shall not affect the validity of any provisions within these Terms of Use that, by their nature, are intended to survive such termination. Provisions that are expressly or implicitly designed to continue in effect and survive termination of these Terms of Use include, but are not limited to, disclaimers and warranties, limitations on liability, indemnification obligations, and retention of personal information.

1. Indemnification. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Agentic Engineer LLC and its officers, directors, owners, agents, employees, information providers, affiliates, licensors, and licensees (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all claims, actions, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, judgments, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs) arising out of or relating to: (i) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (ii) your use of the Agentic Engineer Platforms or Content in a manner that infringes or violates any intellectual-property, privacy, or other rights of Agentic Engineer or any third party; (iii) your violation of applicable law; or (iv) any misuse of data, systems, or access credentials attributable to you or your account.

   Agentic Engineer reserves the right, at its sole discretion and expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification hereunder, in which case you agree to cooperate as reasonably requested. You may not settle any matter without Agentic Engineer’s prior written consent. This indemnification obligation applies to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and does not limit any other legal or equitable remedies available to Agentic Engineer.

1. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL AGENTIC ENGINEER LLC, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, OR SERVICE PROVIDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, GOODWILL, OR USE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF (OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE) THE AGENTIC ENGINEER PLATFORMS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT AGENTIC ENGINEER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL AGENTIC ENGINEER’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE AGENTIC ENGINEER PLATFORMS EXCEED THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU, IF ANY, TO AGENTIC ENGINEER DURING THE SIX (6) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM; OR (B) ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100). SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

1. Third-Party Websites; Links. Where Agentic Engineer provides hypertext links from or to third-party websites, these links are offered solely for the convenience and informational purposes of the user. Agentic Engineer does not review, endorse, approve, or control the content, accuracy, legality, or any other aspect of these third-party websites. Agentic Engineer is not responsible for the practices, products, resources, or services of any third parties linked to or from the Agentic Engineer Platforms. By accessing any third-party website via a link provided on the Agentic Engineer Platforms, the user acknowledges and agrees that such access is entirely at their own risk. Agentic Engineer makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, regarding any third-party website, nor does it accept any responsibility or liability for the content, resources, or services available on those sites. The presence of a hyperlink does not imply any endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation between Agentic Engineer and the third-party websites. The user agrees that Agentic Engineer shall not be held liable for any damages, losses, or expenses arising from the use of, or access to, any third-party websites, whether through direct links or other means of navigation, and that Agentic Engineer shall have no obligation to monitor, verify, or take responsibility for any content found on such external sites. As a result, the user is strongly encouraged to review the terms of use, privacy policies, and other relevant information of any third-party website before interacting with it.

1. Third-Party Messaging Platform Integrations (Discord). Agentic Engineer may offer integrations or interactive features through third-party messaging platforms, including, but not limited to, Discord. By accessing or using any Agentic Engineer feature made available through such third-party platforms, including Discord, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use as well as the applicable terms of service, community guidelines, and privacy policies of the third-party platform(s) involved. It is your responsibility to review and comply with all such third-party terms. In addition, you acknowledge and agree that (i) these third-party messaging platforms shall only be used for appropriate purposes consistent with the intended use of the Agentic Engineer Platforms and these Terms of Use, (ii) we reserve the right, at our sole discretion and without notice, to remove, edit, or delete any messages or content transmitted through such third-party messaging platforms that we determine to be inappropriate, disruptive, or in violation of our policies or applicable law, and (iii) you disclaim and waive any claim to copyright or intellectual-property ownership in any message or content you transmit or submit through such third-party messaging platforms in connection with the Agentic Engineer Platforms. We do not collect or use such data beyond what is necessary to operate the integration, and all use is subject to our Privacy Policy. Agentic Engineer may also utilize third-party service providers, including Clerk for authentication and subscription management, Stripe for payment processing, and Convex for secure data storage. Your use of any features supported by these providers constitutes your acknowledgment and agreement that such services are subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies, which you are responsible for reviewing.

1. Entire Agreement; Modifications. These Terms of Use represent the complete and exclusive agreement between you and Agentic Engineer regarding your access to and use of the Agentic Engineer Platforms. Any prior agreements, understandings, or communications, whether oral or written, are superseded in their entirety. Agentic Engineer may update or modify these Terms of Use at any time, in its sole discretion, and any changes will take effect upon posting on the Agentic Engineer Platforms unless otherwise stated. It is your responsibility to review the Terms of Use periodically, and continued use of the Agentic Engineer Platforms after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms of Use. No waiver, modification, or amendment of these Terms of Use is binding unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Agentic Engineer.

1. International Use; GDPR Notice. The Agentic Engineer Platforms are controlled and operated from within the United States. While we understand that users from outside the United States, including foreign citizens, may have access to and use the Agentic Engineer Platforms, we make no representations or warranties regarding the appropriateness of the Agentic Engineer Platforms or the Agentic Engineer Content for users in other countries. By accessing the Agentic Engineer Platforms from outside the United States, users do so at their own risk. To the extent that any such user accesses the Agentic Engineer Platforms, we are committed to complying with all applicable privacy and data protection laws that govern such access. 

   For residents of the European Union (“EU”), the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) provides certain rights concerning the processing of personal information. If you are a resident of the EU and have questions or concerns about the processing of your personal information, please review our Privacy Policy or contact us directly for further assistance.

1. GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION; JURISDICTION. THESE TERMS OF USE ARE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT-OF-LAWS PRINCIPLES. ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY JAMS UNDER ITS COMPREHENSIVE ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES, INCLUDING ANY APPLICABLE CONSUMER ARBITRATION MINIMUM STANDARDS, UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY LAW.

   THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR AND, UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, HELD VIRTUALLY. THE PARTIES SHALL SHARE ADMINISTRATIVE AND ARBITRATOR FEES AS REQUIRED BY LAW OR BY THE JAMS RULES, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY REALLOCATE SUCH FEES IN THE FINAL AWARD AS PERMITTED. ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY; CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE-ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. EACH PARTY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND THE ARBITRATOR’S DECISION SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING.

   OPT-OUT RIGHT: YOU MAY OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER FIRST ACCEPTING THESE TERMS BY SENDING WRITTEN NOTICE TO SUPPORT@AGENTIC-ENGINEER.COM WITH THE SUBJECT LINE “ARBITRATION OPT-OUT” AND YOUR FULL NAME AND CONTACT INFORMATION. EXERCISING THIS RIGHT WILL NOT AFFECT ANY OTHER TERMS OF YOUR AGREEMENT. THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS AND THE CESSATION OF YOUR USE OF THE AGENTIC ENGINEER PLATFORMS.

   NOTHING IN THIS SECTION PREVENTS EITHER PARTY FROM BRINGING AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIM IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IN THE JURISDICTION WHERE THE USER RESIDES, IF PERMITTED BY THAT COURT’S RULES, OR FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE OR EMERGENCY RELIEF IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL-PROPERTY OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. FOR SUCH PURPOSES, THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS LOCATED IN NEW JERSEY SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION, AND BOTH PARTIES CONSENT TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN THOSE COURTS, WAIVING ANY OBJECTION BASED ON IMPROPER FORUM. IF ANY PROVISION OF THIS SECTION 24 IS FOUND UNENFORCEABLE, THAT PORTION SHALL BE SEVERED AND THE REMAINDER SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.
