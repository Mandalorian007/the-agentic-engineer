## Pricing Strategy & Psychology

### Pricing Principles for Developer Products

**1. Value-Based Pricing**
- Price based on value delivered, not cost to create
- Developers pay for time saved and results achieved
- Calculate ROI: "This saves you 20 hours = $2,000+ in salary"

**2. Anchoring Strategy**
- Show original price (higher) crossed out
- Present premium tier first to make mid-tier attractive
- Use yearly pricing to make monthly seem affordable

**3. Psychological Price Points**

**Digital Products:**
- $29 (impulse buy, "cheap")
- $49 (deliberated buy, good value)
- $79 (professional tier)
- $99 (psychological threshold, premium)
- $149 (serious investment, comprehensive)
- $199+ (enterprise/agency tier)

**Memberships:**
- $9/month (entry level, high conversion)
- $15/month (sweet spot for individual devs)
- $25/month (premium individual)
- $49/month (agency/team implied)
- $99/month (team/corporate)

**Courses:**
- $49 (mini-course, quick win)
- $99 (full course, good value)
- $149 (comprehensive, all-in)

### Price Testing Strategy

## Final Thoughts

You've built an incredible content automation platform. Now it's time to turn that expertise into a revenue-generating business.

The AI agent space is exploding with demand. Developers are desperate for practical, production-ready implementations—not more theory. You're perfectly positioned to provide that.

**Start small, validate quickly, scale what works.**

Within 6 months, you could be generating $5K-15K/month from a combination of:
- Digital products (templates, tools)
- Premium membership
- Online courses
- Affiliate income
- Sponsorships

Within 12 months, you could have a $100K-200K/year business, with the potential to scale much further.

**The hardest part is starting. Ship something this week.**

Good luck building The Agentic Engineer into a monetization powerhouse. 🚀
