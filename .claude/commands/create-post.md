- Add examples and case studies
- Include data and external sources
- Use conversational, active voice
- Avoid jargon unless writing for specialists
- **IMPORTANT**: Always use proper markdown list syntax (`-` or `1.`) even when starting items with emojis (e.g., `- ✅ Item` not just `✅ Item`)

### Visuals & Media
- **Every post MUST include at least one image** (hero/featured image minimum)

## Writing Formulas (When Appropriate)

Consider these copywriting frameworks for persuasive content:

- **PAS** (Problem-Agitate-Solution) - For pain-point driven content
- **BAB** (Before-After-Bridge) - For transformation stories

## Technical Blog Post Considerations

For engineering/technical content, also include:
- Code examples with syntax highlighting
- Architecture diagrams
- Performance metrics/benchmarks
- Prerequisites and environment setup
- Troubleshooting sections
- Links to documentation
- GitHub repos or live demos

## Category Selection

**CRITICAL**: Every post must be assigned to ONE primary category. Analyze the content and choose the best-fit category:

- **case-studies** - Real-world project showcases with results and analysis
- **guides** - Beginner-friendly introductions to complex topics
- **lists** - Curated collections of tips, tools, and strategies
- **comparisons** - Side-by-side comparisons and product reviews
- **problem-solution** - Addressing pain points with practical solutions
- **opinions** - Perspectives, analysis, and myth-busting content

**Alignment with formats:**
- How-To Guide → `tutorials`
- Classic Listicle → `lists`
- Detailed Case Study → `case-studies`
- Comparison Post → `comparisons`
- Beginner's Guide → `guides`
- Problem-Solution → `problem-solution`
- Opinion/Myth Debunker → `opinions`

## Output Format Requirements

Create a complete blog post following this project's structure:

1. **File name suggestion** (YYYY-MM-DD-slug.mdx format)
2. **Frontmatter** (title, description, date, category, hashtags)
3. **Full MDX content** with proper heading hierarchy
4. **Image suggestions** - **REQUIRED: Every post must have at least one image** (hero/featured image). When suggesting images, provide the exact command to generate them with detailed, descriptive prompts:
   ```bash
   uv run tools/generate_image.py "modern minimalist illustration of a robot writing code at a desk, blue and purple gradient background, clean tech aesthetic, isometric view" website/public/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/image-name.webp
   ```
   - Minimum: 1 hero image at the top of the post
   - Recommended: Additional images for major sections, diagrams, or examples
   - **Prompt tips**: Be specific about style (minimalist, modern, flat design), colors, perspective, subject details, and mood
   - **Note**: Images are automatically generated and converted to WebP format by `generate_image.py`

## Saving the Post to Disk

**CRITICAL**: Always save posts using Write tool to `website/content/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.mdx`

### File Structure
```
website/
├── content/posts/
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD-slug.mdx                    # Single MDX file (Write tool saves here)
└── public/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/
    ├── hero-blog-automation.webp              # Images in WebP format
    └── diagram-oauth-flow.webp                # Descriptive slug-style names
```

### Frontmatter (Required at top of MDX file)
```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
description: "Compelling 150-160 character SEO description that summarizes the post value"
date: "2025-10-12T10:00:00Z"
category: "tutorials"
hashtags: ["python", "automation", "workflow"]
---
```

**Frontmatter Fields:**
- `title` (required) - Post title, 30-60 chars optimal for SEO
- `description` (required) - SEO meta description, 150-160 chars, summarizes post value
- `date` (required) - ISO 8601 format with quotes (future dates hide post until that date)
- `category` (required) - ONE category from the 7 options above
- `hashtags` (optional) - Array of freeform hashtags, display-only (not for filtering)

### Image References & Naming
- Use relative paths from MDX location: `![Alt text](../../public/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/hero-blog-automation.webp)`
- Images are automatically generated in WebP format by `generate_image.py`
- Name images with descriptive slugs: `hero-topic-name.webp`, `diagram-what-it-shows.webp`, `screenshot-feature-name.webp`
- Save to: `website/public/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/`
- Path format: `../../public/blog/[post-slug]/[image-name].webp` (relative from `content/posts/` to `public/blog/`)
- Next.js automatically converts these to `/blog/...` URLs at render time

## Process

1. **Ask clarifying questions** if the writeup is unclear:
   - What's the main goal? (educate, persuade, showcase, compare?)
   - Who's the target audience? (beginners, experienced devs, specific role?)
   - What action should readers take?
   - Any specific examples or data to include?

2. **Recommend a format** based on the content and explain why

3. **Select the appropriate category** from the 7 options based on the chosen format

4. **Create an outline** showing the structure before writing

5. **Write the complete post** following the chosen format as MDX

6. **Generate images** - Create at least one hero image using `generate_image.py` (outputs WebP directly)

7. **Save to disk** - Write MDX file to `website/content/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.mdx` with proper frontmatter
